# LargeScaleCircuit
Large scale circuit course's lab 

First assignment is to create a counter, use that counter to measure a time interval (e.g. 1 second) and blink an LED on the FPGA board with that interval (toggle a signal every time that interval has elapsed). a link to the EDA Playground where you simulated it and if that's not the complete code attach the code to the document. 

The second assignment is to measure time using the knowledge from the previous assignment and to display it on the 4 digit 7 segment display on the Nexys 2 board.
